# Simple Linear Regression Model
This notebook contains a simple linear regression model that predicts an employee's salary based on their years of experience. The model uses gradient descent to optimize the cost function and minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and actual salaries.

## Files
- salary_data.csv: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- linear_regression.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for the model.

## Requirements
- To run the code in this notebook, you need the following packages:

1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib

You can install these packages by running pip install pandas numpy matplotlib.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages as mentioned above.
3. Run the linear_regression.ipynb notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.
4. The notebook will load the dataset and train the model using gradient descent.
5. After training, the notebook will display the cost and model parameters (slope and intercept).
6. Finally, the notebook will plot the regression line and display the predicted salaries for some test data.
